    "The 'basketball players stats per season-49 leagues' dataset was used for this project. It comprises player data for 49 leagues from 1999 to present. The dataset was downlaoded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance/home) in January, 2020a dn is available at: [https://www.kaggle.com/jacobbaruch/basketball-players-stats-per-season-49-leagues](https://www.kaggle.com/jacobbaruch/basketball-players-stats-per-season-49-leagues). In total ~11 thousand players data was collected in 49 leagues for each season.
