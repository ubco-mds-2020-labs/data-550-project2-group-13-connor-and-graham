# Summary of Contributions

Below, briefly describe the specific contribution(s) each team member (including yourself) made to your project. 
Both partners should contribute to this file from their own perspectives.
Point form is fine, but you should use the following format:

## Group Work

- How did the team work together as a whole overall ?
- We worked well together. We were more used to how the other person works this time, so it required less communication during the process which made things more efficient. 

## Contributions

### Connor's Contributions

- data exploration and initial thoughts. 
- Data wrangling and code for 3/6 visualizations with descriptions of visualizations.
- Summary and final editing/compiling.
- Contributed half of research questions.

### Graham's Contributions

- Loaded and wrote the description of the dataset. 
- Data wrangling and code for 3/6 visualizations with descriptions of visualizations.
- Contributed half of research questions. 
- Did a final review of the project before submission. 

## Things that went well

- We made better use of branching and merging in Github this time compared to the last mini-project.
- We communicated well and stuck to our timeline even with a busy week of other class assignments. 

## Things that went poorly

- We had a similar flavour to some our visualizations (multiple visualizations based on 3-pointers). In the future we could explore more diverse topics to explore more aspects of the data in our EDA.
